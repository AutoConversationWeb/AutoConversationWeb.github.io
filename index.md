# Closure notice

The Auto Conversation Unofficial Git Hub Site has to close, affective immediately due to a letter from the CEO of Auto Chat, AutoChatAdmin, or "ACA"

It was fun while it lasted, but... well, me and ads aren't on... "good terms" anymore. We aren't here to 'get along'


So, that's it, the end of the AC git hub.

Signed,
Apple
